    I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be educational, and perhaps
    to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun. Please hack this, change it and use it
    in any way you see fit. BUT, you acknowledge that I am not responsible for anything
    bad that happens as a result of your actions. However, if good stuff happens, I
    would appreciate a shout out, or at least give the blog some publicity for me.
    Cheers!
    Background
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    Whilst waiting for TheMexicanRunner to start the finale of his NesMania project,
    his Twitch stream had a counter counting down for a couple of hours until it started.
    With some time on my hands, I thought it might be fun to see what the graphical
    capabilities of the console are. Turns out, not very much, but hey, it's nice to think
    Wolfenstein could have existed a few years earlier, and in just ~200 lines of code.
    IMPORTANT!!!!
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    READ ME BEFORE RUNNING!!! This program expects the console dimensions to be set to
    120 Columns by 40 Rows. I recommend a small font "Consolas" at size 16. You can do this
    by running the program, and right clicking on the console title bar, and specifying
    the properties. You can also choose to default to them in the future.

    Controls: A = Turn Left, D = Turn Right, W = Walk Forwards, S = Walk Backwards
    Future Modifications
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1) Shade block segments based on angle from player, i.e. less light reflected off
    walls at side of player. Walls straight on are brightest.
    2) Find an interesting and optimised ray-tracing method. I'm sure one must exist
    to more optimally search the map space
    3) Add bullets!
    4) Add bad guys!
